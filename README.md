# History of Singapore

## Early History (14th-19th Century)
Singapore was originally known as Temasek, a Malay fishing village. According to legend, Prince Sang Nila Utama founded the settlement in the 14th century after spotting a lion, naming it "Singapura" (Lion City).

## Colonial Period (1819-1963)
In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles established a British trading post on the island. Singapore became a crucial port in the British Empire, serving as a vital link between Europe and Asia. The city grew rapidly as immigrants from China, India, and the Malay Peninsula arrived seeking economic opportunities.

During World War II (1942-1945), Singapore fell to Japanese forces, leading to a brutal occupation period that deeply impacted the local population.

## Path to Independence (1963-1965)
Singapore briefly joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 but was expelled in 1965 due to political and economic disagreements, becoming an independent nation on August 9, 1965.

## Modern Singapore (1965-Present)
Under the leadership of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore transformed from a developing nation into a prosperous city-state. Key achievements include:

- Rapid industrialization and economic growth
- Development into a major financial hub
- Transformation into a garden city with strict environmental policies
- Establishment as a global trading and shipping center
- Evolution into a modern multicultural society

Today, Singapore is one of the world's most developed countries, known for its efficient governance, economic prosperity, and cultural diversity.
