# MITM Experiment 😄

## Introduction

This project is an educational experiment focused on man-in-the-middle (MITM) techniques and network security analysis. But first, let's lighten the mood with some jokes!

## Funny Programming Jokes 🤣

### Network Security Humor
- Why don't hackers ever get tired? Because they always find a way to *refresh* themselves!
- What did the packet say when it got dropped? "I guess I'll just have to *retry* later!"
- Why did the firewall break up with the router? It said their relationship had too many *blocked connections*!

### General Programming Jokes
- Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs! 🐛
- How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? None. That's a hardware problem.
- Why did the developer go broke? Because they used up all their cache! 💰
- What's a programmer's favorite hangout place? Foo Bar! 🍺
- Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#! 👓

### Debugging Humor
- 99 little bugs in the code, 99 little bugs. Take one down, patch it around, 127 little bugs in the code.
- "It works on my machine" ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production.

### Network Jokes
- Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open! 🪟
- What do you call a computer that sings? A-dell! 🎵
- Why don't computers take their hats off? Because they have bad CAPS LOCK! 🧢
