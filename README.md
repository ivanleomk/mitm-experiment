# History of Singapore

## Early History (13th-19th Century)
Singapore was originally known as **Temasek** ("Sea Town" in Javanese), a small Malay fishing village. According to legend, it was renamed **Singapura** ("Lion City") in the 14th century by Prince Sang Nila Utama, who claimed to have seen a lion on the island.

## British Colonial Period (1819-1963)
In 1819, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles established a British trading post on the island, transforming it into a major port city. Singapore became a Crown Colony in 1867 and served as a crucial hub for British trade in Southeast Asia.

## World War II (1942-1945)
Singapore fell to Japanese forces in February 1942, marking what Winston Churchill called "the worst disaster" in British military history. The occupation lasted until 1945 and profoundly impacted the local population.

## Path to Independence (1945-1965)
After WWII, Singapore moved toward self-governance. It briefly joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 but was expelled in 1965 due to political and racial tensions.

## Modern Singapore (1965-Present)
Under Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's leadership, Singapore transformed from a developing nation into a prosperous city-state. Today, it's a global financial hub, major port, and one of the world's wealthiest countries per capita.

## Key Founding Figures

### Lee Kuan Yew (1923-2015)
Singapore's first Prime Minister and founding father, **Lee Kuan Yew** served from 1959 to 1990. Known for his pragmatic governance style, he implemented policies focusing on education, economic development, and racial harmony. His vision transformed Singapore from a third-world to first-world nation in one generation.

### Kwa Geok Choo (1920-2010)
**Kwa Geok Choo**, Lee Kuan Yew's wife, was a pioneering lawyer and one of Singapore's first female legal practitioners. She graduated from Cambridge University and was called to the Bar in 1953. Beyond her legal career, she was instrumental in supporting her husband's political journey and was known for her intelligence and strong character. Their 61-year marriage was considered one of Singapore's great love stories.
